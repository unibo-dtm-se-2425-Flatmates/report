# Disclaimer
During the preparation of this work, Generative Artificial Intelligence tools, specifically **Microsoft Copilot**, were used solely during the code implementation and finalization stages. It is important to note that these tools were not involved in the design, architecture, or requirements definition of the project. All design decisions, structural frameworks, and core logic originated from the collaborative efforts of the team. Microsoft Copilot served as a supportive coding assistant, especially during very repetitive tasks (e.g. adding docstrings), and accelerate the development of specific software components. Its use focused on leveraging AI to supplement knowledge of particular libraries and to generate initial code structures that were subsequently reviewed, refined, and manually integrated by the team. Following the use of these tools, all output was thoroughly reviewed and edited by the authors, who assume full responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of the final content.
